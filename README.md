GameWiki is an AI-assisted tool for generating consistent, interconnected wiki content for fantasy settings. Whether you're building a world for a tabletop RPG, video game, novel, or any other creative project, GameWiki helps you create and maintain comprehensive documentation.

## Overview

GameWiki uses large language models to generate wiki articles that maintain consistency with each other. The system manages cross-references between articles, visualizes connections between concepts, and provides both JSON and Markdown output formats.

### Key Features

- AI-powered wiki article generation
- Automatic cross-referencing and link management

## How It Works

1. Configure a game universe in the system
2. Use AI to generate initial seed articles
3. Expand the wiki by having the AI generate new articles that reference existing ones
4. View the resulting files with a markdown viewer
