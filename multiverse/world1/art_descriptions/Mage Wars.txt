Given the limited budget, the value of each piece should be weighed against the potential impact it could have on the players' understanding and immersion in the story. The "The Wars Begin" section is likely the most valuable in terms of artistic and descriptive value, as it sets the stage for the entire campaign and can be a powerful visual hook for the players. The "Impact on the Realm" section could also be valuable for world-building, while the "Aftermath and Legacy" section, although important, might be less visually impactful and could potentially be skipped if budget constraints are tight.
