Given the limited budget, the "Types of Orbs" section would be the most valuable to illustrate, as it directly relates to the objects of interest in the campaign and provides a visual differentiation between the orbs. The "Crafting and Artisanship" section could also be valuable for players interested in the creation process. The "In Popular Culture" section might be lower priority unless the cultural aspects are central to the campaign's storyline or player engagement.
