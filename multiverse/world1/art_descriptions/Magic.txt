Given the limited budget, the value of each piece should be weighed against the potential impact on the players' immersion and understanding of the world. The "Arcane and Divine" and "Weave of Magic" sections are central to the understanding of magic in Aesheron and would greatly benefit from visual representation. The "Centers of Magical Study" could be valuable for world-building but might be less critical if budget constraints are tight.
