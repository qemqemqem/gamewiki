Given the budget constraints, it may be wise to prioritize the "Methods of Divination" section for its descriptive value in illustrating the various practices, and the "Places of Power" section for its potential to evoke a sense of wonder and place. The "Notable Diviners" section, while interesting, could be considered less essential due to the potential cost of creating multiple detailed character portraits.
