Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Water in Culture and Society" section for artwork, as it captures an important cultural event that is central to the story and would provide a strong visual element for the players. The "Water Elementals and Sprites" section could also be a good choice, as it directly relates to potential allies or adversaries in the game. The "Nature of Water" section, while descriptive, may not require an illustration as urgently as the other two, considering budget constraints.
