Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Origins and Nature" and "Elemental Summoning" sections for artwork, as they are central to understanding what Water Elementals are and how they interact with the world. These images would have high descriptive value and contribute significantly to the immersion of your players in the campaign's lore.
