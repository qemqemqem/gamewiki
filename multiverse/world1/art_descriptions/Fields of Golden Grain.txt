Given the limited budget, prioritize the art that adds the most value to the players' understanding and enjoyment of the world. The "Geography" section is likely the most valuable, as it helps players visualize the setting they are adventuring in. The "Culture" section could greatly enhance the immersion by showing the community life. The "Flora and Fauna" section, while interesting, might be considered a lower priority unless these elements play a significant role in the campaign's story or gameplay.
