Given the limited budget, I would prioritize the "Geography" and "Magic and Phenomena" sections for artwork, as they are likely to have the highest descriptive value and add a significant sense of wonder to the article. The "Inhabitants" section could also benefit from a visual representation, but if budget constraints are tight, the text descriptions may suffice. The "Interaction with Other Planes" could be visually striking but may be considered a lower priority compared to the other sections.
