Given the limited budget, the "Appearance and Behavior" section would likely offer the most value in terms of both artistic and descriptive elements, as it directly visualizes the subject of the article. The "Habitat and Ecology" section could also be valuable, but it may be more complex and costly due to the need to depict multiple characters and a detailed environment. The "Cultural Significance" section, while interesting, might be less critical to include if budget constraints are a primary concern.
