Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "The Shrouded City" section for artwork, as it encapsulates the essence of mystery and adventure that is central to the theme of treasure hunting. The artistic and descriptive value of this piece would be high, and it would likely captivate the players' imaginations. The other sections, while also valuable, could be considered secondary due to budget constraints.
