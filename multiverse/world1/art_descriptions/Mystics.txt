Given the limited budget, the value of each piece should be weighed against the potential impact it could have on the players' immersion and understanding of the world. The "Origins and Beliefs" section is central to the understanding of mystics and would benefit greatly from an illustration. The "Practices and Abilities" section could also use a visual to help players imagine the rituals and ceremonies. Lastly, the "Places of Power" section is a prime candidate for artwork, as it can provide a visual anchor for important locations within the campaign.
