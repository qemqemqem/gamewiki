Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize the sections with the highest descriptive and artistic value. The "Geography" section is a strong candidate as it sets the scene for the entire Sea of Lost Souls, providing a visual anchor for the readers. The "Properties and Phenomena" section could also be valuable due to its potential to showcase the unique magical qualities of the sea. The "Inhabitants" section might be lower priority unless the Lady of Sorrows or Water Elementals are central to the campaign's narrative.
