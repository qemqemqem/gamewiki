Given the limited budget, I would prioritize the "Origins and Training" section for its potential to capture the imagination and provide a historical context for the healers. The "Clerical Healers" section could also be valuable for its ability to convey the spiritual aspect of healing. The "Role in Society" section, while important, might be better represented through descriptive text rather than art due to the complexity of depicting a bustling community scene.
