Given the limited budget, the "Casting the Spell" section would likely provide the most value for an illustration, as it directly relates to the action of using the spell and can visually explain the process and components involved. The "Cultural Significance" and "In Literature and Legend" sections, while interesting, may be less critical for visual representation if budget constraints are a significant concern.
