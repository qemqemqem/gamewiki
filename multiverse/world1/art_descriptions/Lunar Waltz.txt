Given the limited budget, the value of each piece should be considered carefully. The Moonflower Festival offers the most narrative and descriptive value, capturing a central event of the Lunar Waltz. The Shrouded City provides a contrasting atmosphere that could be depicted with a simpler sketch, offering high artistic but lower descriptive value. The Plains of Valor scene is visually stunning but might be more complex and costly to produce due to the dynamic nature of the horses and the environment. Prioritize based on the impact each image will have on the players' immersion and understanding of the world.
