Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize art that adds the most value to the understanding and enjoyment of the content. The sections "Origins and Training" and "Divine Magic" could greatly benefit from visuals, as they depict core aspects of paladins that are central to their role in the world. The "Legendary Paladins" section could also be a good candidate for art, as it can bring to life the figures that players might aspire to emulate. The "Paladin's Code" might be lower priority due to its abstract nature, which could be conveyed through text effectively.
