Given the limited budget, prioritize the "Geography and Environment" section for its broad descriptive value and potential to set the tone for the entire Infernal Planes. The "Notable Locations" could be a secondary priority, providing specific points of interest. The "Magic and the Infernal Planes" and "Rituals and Summoning" sections could be considered if the budget allows, as they add depth to the understanding of the world's magic and culture.
