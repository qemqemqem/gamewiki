Given the limited budget, the value of the art should be considered carefully. The "History of Summoning" section is likely the most valuable in terms of both artistic and descriptive value, as it depicts a pivotal historical event and the legendary figure of Morath the Wise. The "Types of Summoning" could also be valuable for descriptive purposes, but might be less critical if budget constraints are tight. The "Summoning in Society" section, while interesting, may not be as essential since the text already provides a clear description of the societal roles of summoning. Prioritize based on the impact each image would have on the players' understanding and immersion in the world.
