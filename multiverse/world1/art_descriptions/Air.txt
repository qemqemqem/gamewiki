Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Air in Magic and Spellcraft" and "Air in Culture and Religion" sections for artwork, as they are likely to resonate most with players and provide a rich visual context for the game. The "Threats to the Balance of Air" could also be impactful but might be more complex and costly to produce. The "Essence of Air" is less critical and could be skipped if budget constraints are tight.
