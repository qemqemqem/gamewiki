Given the limited budget, the value of each piece should be considered harshly. The "History and Mythology" and "Architecture and Features" sections are the most valuable for their historical and descriptive content, and they would greatly enhance the reader's understanding and immersion. The "Lunar Waltz" and "In Modern Times" sections could be considered secondary priorities due to their narrative value, but they might be less essential if the budget is very tight.
