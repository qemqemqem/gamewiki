Given the limited budget, the "Habitat and Behavior" and "Role in Society" sections are the most valuable for adding visual elements, as they provide significant insight into the Windcutter Hawks' natural environment and their importance in the world's cultures. The "In Warfare" section could also be impactful, but it may be more complex and costly due to the dynamic nature of the scene. The "Conservation" section, while important, may not be as visually striking or essential as the others.
