Given the limited budget, it is important to prioritize the sections that would benefit most from visual representation. The "Healing and Medicine" section is central to the role of an Herbalist and would greatly benefit from an illustration. The "Alchemical Contributions" section could also use a visual to depict the collaboration between Herbalists and Alchemists. Lastly, the "Challenges and Adventures" section would be enhanced by an image showing the perils Herbalists face, adding excitement and depth to the article.
