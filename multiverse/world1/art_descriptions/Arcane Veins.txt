Given the limited budget, the value of each piece should be weighed against the potential impact it could have on the players' understanding and immersion in the world. The "Cultural Significance" section might offer the most value, as it directly relates to the players' experience of the world's culture and festivities, which could be a significant part of their campaign. The "Nature and Properties" section could also be valuable for visualizing the abstract concept of Arcane Veins. The "Threats and Conservation" section, while important, might be less immediately impactful in a visual sense unless the campaign heavily involves these themes.
