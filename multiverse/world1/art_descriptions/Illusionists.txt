Given the limited budget, I would prioritize the "History and Influence" and "The Enchanted Grove and Festivals" sections for artwork, as they provide rich visual opportunities that enhance the reader's understanding and immersion in the world. The "Notable Illusionists and Locations" section could also benefit from a single, striking image of Tharion, which would serve as a memorable representation of Illusionist prowess. The "Applications of Illusion Magic" section, while interesting, could be lower priority due to the complexity of depicting multiple scenarios in one piece.
