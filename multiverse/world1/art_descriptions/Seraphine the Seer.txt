Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Mastery of Evocation" section for artwork, as it captures the essence of Seraphine's magical prowess and would likely be the most visually striking and engaging for players. The other sections, while valuable, could be supplemented with text descriptions if necessary to convey the information within budget constraints.
