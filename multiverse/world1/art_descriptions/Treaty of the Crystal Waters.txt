Given the limited budget, the "Negotiations" section is the most critical to illustrate, as it captures a pivotal moment in the treaty's history. The "Significance" section could be the next priority, emphasizing the cultural and spiritual aspects of the treaty. The "Legacy" section, while valuable, might be less critical and could be considered if the budget allows for additional artwork.
