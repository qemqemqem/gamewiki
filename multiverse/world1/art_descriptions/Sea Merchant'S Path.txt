Given the limited budget, the value ratings are harsh, and the focus should be on the most impactful visuals that contribute significantly to the understanding and enjoyment of the article. The Geography section with a map has high descriptive value and can be a single piece without the need for multiple parts or characters. The Dangers and Challenges section offers exciting artistic value but may be more complex and costly due to the action and characters involved. The Cultural Significance section has both artistic and descriptive value, showcasing the diversity and vibrancy of the world, but it also requires depicting multiple characters and goods.
