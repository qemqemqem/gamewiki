Given the limited budget and the need to prioritize, the "Geography" section would likely offer the most value for a visual addition, as it sets the scene for the entire Echoing Basin and provides context for the rest of the article. The "Acoustic Properties" and "Cultural Significance" sections could also benefit from visuals, but they may be more complex and costly to produce due to their more abstract or narrative-driven content.
