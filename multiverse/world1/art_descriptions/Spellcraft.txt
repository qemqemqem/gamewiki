Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize the sections that would benefit most from visual aids. The "History of Spellcraft" and "The Role of Rituals" sections are prime candidates for artwork due to their historical and narrative significance. The "Schools of Magic" could be valuable for players to visualize the differences between the schools. The "Ethical Considerations" section could be impactful but might be lower priority due to its abstract nature.
