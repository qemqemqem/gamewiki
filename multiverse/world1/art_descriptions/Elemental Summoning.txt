Given the limited budget, the value of each piece of art should be weighed against its potential impact on the players' immersion and understanding of the game world. The "Summoning Process" and "Applications of Elemental Summoning" sections are likely to have the highest descriptive and artistic value, providing visual aids to complex concepts and showcasing the practical uses of summoning in the game world. The "Risks and Precautions" section, while exciting, may be less critical if budget constraints require prioritization.
