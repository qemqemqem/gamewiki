Given the limited budget and the need for harsh value assessment, these two sections, "Appearance" and "Festivals and Rituals," are the most visually compelling and central to the understanding of the Lady of Sorrows and her impact on the Shadar-Kai culture. They provide a strong narrative and descriptive value, offering both a glimpse into the character of the Lady and the customs of her followers. The artistic value in depicting these scenes would be high, as they could serve to immerse the players deeply into the world and enhance their connection to the story.
