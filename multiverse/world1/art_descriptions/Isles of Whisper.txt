Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Geography" section for artwork, as it sets the scene for the entire campaign and can be used repeatedly to immerse players in the setting. The "Legends and Lore" section could also be valuable for visual storytelling and engaging player interest in the mysteries of the Isles. The "Flora and Fauna" section, while interesting, may be less critical and could be described in text or with simpler illustrations if budget constraints are tight.
