Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Dance of the Leaves" section for artwork, as it encapsulates the magical essence of the festival and would likely be the most visually impactful for your players. The "Summoning the Spirits" could also be a strong contender for its mystical and otherworldly visuals. The "Culinary Delights" section, while interesting, may be lower priority unless food and feasting are central themes in your campaign.
