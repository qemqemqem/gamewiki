Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize which images will add the most value to the article. The "History and Formation" section could benefit greatly from a visual representation, as it sets the stage for the Council's role and significance. The "Influence and Power" section may be less visually impactful but could still provide narrative depth. The "Controversies and Conflicts" section offers an opportunity for a powerful image that could resonate emotionally with the readers, making it a strong candidate for inclusion.
