Given the limited budget, the section "Origin and Creation" might be the most valuable to illustrate, as it sets the stage for the entire concept of the artifacts and can be rich in visual lore. The "Known Artifacts" section is also a strong candidate, as it showcases specific items that players may encounter. The "Properties and Abilities" section could be skipped if necessary, as the text itself is quite descriptive.
