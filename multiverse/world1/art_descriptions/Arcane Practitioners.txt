Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize images that offer the highest descriptive value and can be used in multiple contexts. The art for "Wizards" and "Artificers" would likely be the most valuable, as they depict central figures of the arcane world and their environments, which can be referenced repeatedly throughout the campaign.
