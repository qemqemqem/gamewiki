Given the limited budget, the "Training and Abilities" section would be the most valuable to illustrate, as it provides a direct look into the world of arcane practitioners and can enrich the players' understanding of their training and environment. The "Role in Society" could be the next priority, as it shows the practitioners' impact on the world, which is central to the game's narrative. The "Notable Arcane Practitioners" section, while interesting, may be less critical as it focuses on historical figures rather than the immediate game world.
