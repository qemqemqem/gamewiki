Given the limited budget, the sections chosen for illustration should be those that add the most value to the reader's understanding and immersion in the world. The "Tharion, the Deity" and "Tharion, the General" sections are likely to have the highest descriptive and artistic value, providing visual context to significant aspects of Tharion's influence. The "Tharion, the Master Archivist" could also be valuable, but if budget constraints are tight, focusing on the first two may suffice.
