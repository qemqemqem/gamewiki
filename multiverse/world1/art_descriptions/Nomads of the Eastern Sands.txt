Given the limited budget, I would prioritize the "Religion and Beliefs" section for its potential to add a mystical and cultural depth to the understanding of the nomads, followed by "Economy and Trade" for its world-building and interaction with other cultures. The "Challenges and Threats" section could be visually striking but may be less essential if budget constraints are tight.
