Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Geography" section for artwork, as it sets the scene for the entire campaign and can be referred to repeatedly by players for immersion. The "Flora and Fauna" section would be the next priority, as it helps players visualize the creatures they might encounter. The "History and Culture" section, while important, could potentially be conveyed through storytelling and descriptions during gameplay, making artwork for this section a lower priority.
