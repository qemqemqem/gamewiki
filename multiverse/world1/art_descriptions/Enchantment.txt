Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Enchanted Artifacts" section for artwork, as it directly relates to items that players might encounter or seek out, providing both artistic and descriptive value. The "Places of Enchantment" could be the next priority, as it sets the scene for potential adventures. The "Enchantment Techniques" section, while interesting, might be lower priority unless the campaign focuses heavily on the crafting aspect of enchantment.
