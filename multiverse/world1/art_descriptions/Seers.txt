Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize the sections that would benefit most from visual representation. The "Origins and Abilities" and "Notable Seers" sections are likely the most valuable in terms of both artistic and descriptive value, as they can help players visualize the Seers and their importance in the world. The "Role in Society" and "Training and Lifestyle" sections could also be enhanced with visuals but may be considered secondary priorities.
