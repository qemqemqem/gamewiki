Given the limited budget, I would prioritize the "Origin and Habitat" section for its potential to capture the imagination and set the scene for the Silvermane Horses in their natural environment. This artwork would have high descriptive and artistic value, providing a strong visual anchor for the article. The "Characteristics" section would also be valuable for a detailed depiction of the horses, but if the budget is very tight, this could be a secondary priority. The "Role in Society" and "Cultural Significance" sections could be considered if additional funds become available, as they would add depth to the understanding of the horses' place in the world.
