Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize the sections that would benefit most from visual representation. The "Society" and "Culture" sections are prime candidates for artwork, as they can help players visualize the setting and the feel of Elven life. The "Military" section could also be valuable, especially if the campaign involves combat and the players will encounter Elven sky-knights. The other sections might not require images as urgently, as they deal more with abstract concepts or historical events that can be effectively conveyed through text.
