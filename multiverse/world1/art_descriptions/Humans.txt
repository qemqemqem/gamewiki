Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Society and Culture" section for artwork, as it encapsulates the vibrancy of Human life and can serve as a visual representation of their cultural richness, which is central to the players' understanding of the world. The "Magic and Religion" section could be the next priority, as it visually demonstrates the range of Human spirituality and magical practices. The "Notable Humans" section, while interesting, could be lower priority due to the potential cost of character-specific art and the fact that descriptions of these characters can be conveyed through text.
