Given the limited budget, the artistic and descriptive value should be weighed against the cost of producing such detailed and diverse artwork. The Geography section may offer the most significant visual impact for understanding the setting, while the Isles of Whisper could provide a compelling narrative visual. The Flora and Fauna section, while offering a high descriptive value, might be less essential if budget constraints are tight.
