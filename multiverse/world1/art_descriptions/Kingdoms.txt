Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "The Northern Realms" and "The Verdant Kingdoms" sections for artwork, as they provide a strong sense of place and character, which can greatly enhance the players' immersion in the world. The "Politics and Power" section, while interesting, might be more abstract and less immediately impactful in visual form.
