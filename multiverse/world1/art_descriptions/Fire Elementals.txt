Given the limited budget, the Physiology section would likely provide the most value, as it directly relates to the reader's understanding of what a fire elemental is and helps them visualize the creature they might encounter in the game. The Summoning and Pact section could also be valuable for setting the scene for an important story event. The Role in the World section, while interesting, might be less essential if budget constraints are tight.
