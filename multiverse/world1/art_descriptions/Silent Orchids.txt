Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Habitat" section for artwork, as it provides a broad and immersive view of the Silent Orchids' environment, which is central to understanding their nature and significance in the world. The "Cultural Significance" and "Mysterious Origins" sections could follow if additional budget becomes available, as they add depth to the lore and emotional connection to the Silent Orchids.
