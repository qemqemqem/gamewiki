Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize the sections with the highest artistic and descriptive value. The "Geographic Location" section would likely be the most valuable to illustrate, as it sets the scene for the entire article and provides a strong visual foundation for the readers' imagination. The "Druidic Practices" and "Flora and Fauna" sections also offer high value, but if the budget allows for only one illustration, the "Geographic Location" should be the choice.
