Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize the sections that would benefit most from visual aids. The "Origins and Nature" and "Habitat" sections are prime candidates for artwork due to their descriptive nature and potential to visually captivate the reader. The "Role in the Ecosystem" could also be valuable, but if the budget is very tight, it might be the first to cut. The "Myths and Legends" section could be enhanced with art, but it's not as crucial as the others, as the text itself can convey much of the folklore.
