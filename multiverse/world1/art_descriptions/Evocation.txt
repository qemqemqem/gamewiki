Given the limited budget and the need for harsh value assessment, these two sections seem to offer the most significant impact for visual additions. The "Applications of Evocation" section provides a broad view of the magic's uses, which could be visually striking and informative for players. The "Notable Evokers" section offers a chance to bring a legendary character to life, adding depth and interest to the lore. Other sections may not benefit as much from visual representation or may require more complex and potentially costly artwork.
