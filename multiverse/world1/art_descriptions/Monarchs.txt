Given the limited budget, the "Ascension to the Throne" section is the most valuable to illustrate, as it captures a pivotal moment that is central to the concept of monarchy. The "Influence of Monarchs" section with a map could be done in a simpler style to save costs while still providing high descriptive value. The "The Role of Magic" section is also important, but if budget constraints are tight, this could be a more modest piece or even omitted.
