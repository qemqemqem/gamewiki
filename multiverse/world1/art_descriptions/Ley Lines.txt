Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize the sections that would benefit the most from visual aids. The "Influence on the World" section is rated high in both artistic and descriptive value, making it a good candidate for art. The "Utilization and Control" section also has high descriptive value, especially for showing architectural alignment, which is a unique aspect of the world. The "Threats and Protection" section could be visually striking but might be more complex and costly due to the multipart nature of the scene.
