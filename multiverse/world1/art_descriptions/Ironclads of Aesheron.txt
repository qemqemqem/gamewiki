Given the limited budget, the "Design and Construction" section would likely offer the highest descriptive value, providing a visual foundation for the Ironclads' legendary status. The "Armament" section could be valuable for its exciting depiction of battle, which could enhance engagement with the article. The "Legacy" section, while interesting, might be considered a lower priority due to the potential overlap with other fantasy tropes and settings.
