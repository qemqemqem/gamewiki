Given the limited budget and the need for harsh value assessment, the "Magical Properties" section seems to offer the most value in terms of both artistic and descriptive elements. It directly relates to the core theme of the article—crystals and their use in magic. The "Cultural Significance" section could also be valuable, as it provides context on how crystals are woven into the daily life and craftsmanship of Aesheron. The "Locations of Note" could be lower priority unless the campaign heavily features these areas, in which case a visual could enhance the players' immersion.
