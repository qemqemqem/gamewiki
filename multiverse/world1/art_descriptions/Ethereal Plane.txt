Given the limited budget, the value of adding art to these sections should be weighed against the cost. The "Nature of the Ethereal Plane" and "The City of Lumina" sections would benefit the most from visuals, as they help establish the setting and mood of the campaign. The "Threats and Dangers" section could be valuable for illustrating the potential perils that players might face, but it might be less essential if budget constraints are tight.
