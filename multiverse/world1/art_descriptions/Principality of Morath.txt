Given the limited budget, the Geography section would likely offer the most value for a single piece of art, as it sets the scene for the entire principality and can be referenced repeatedly throughout the campaign. The Culture section would also be valuable, but it might be more complex and costly due to the detail required for the festival and library scenes. The Notable Figures and Groups could be valuable if these characters are central to the campaign, but individual portraits may be less necessary if the descriptions in the text are vivid.
