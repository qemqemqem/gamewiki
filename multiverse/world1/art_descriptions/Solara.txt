Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize the "Worship and Temples" section for its high descriptive and artistic value, as it directly relates to the daily worship and setting of the story. The "Mythology and Legends" section could also be a good choice for its narrative significance and potential to be visually striking. The "Divine Family and Relationships" section, while interesting, may be less essential and could be depicted through simpler sketches if budget allows.
