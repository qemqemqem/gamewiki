Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize the sections that would benefit most from visual representation. The "Divine Magic and Worship" and "Temples and Sacred Sites" sections are prime candidates for artwork, as they can greatly enhance the reader's understanding and immersion in the world. The "Notable Priests" section could be valuable as well, but may be less critical if budget constraints are tight.
