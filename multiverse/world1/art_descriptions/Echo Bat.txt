Given the limited budget, it may be best to prioritize the "Physical Description" section for artwork, as it provides a clear and focused depiction of the Echo Bat, which is central to the article. The "Habitat and Behavior" section could also be valuable, as it gives context to the Echo Bat's environment and behavior. The "Cultural Significance" section, while interesting, may be less critical and could be considered if the budget allows for additional artwork.
