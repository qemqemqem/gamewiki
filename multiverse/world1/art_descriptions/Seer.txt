Given the limited budget, the value of each piece should be considered carefully. The "Origins and Abilities" section is likely the most valuable in terms of both artistic and descriptive value, as it directly illustrates the core concept of what a seer is and does. The "Role in Society" section could also benefit from an illustration to emphasize the seer's importance in the world. The "Challenges and Controversies" section, while interesting, might be less critical to visualize due to the abstract nature of skepticism and deception, which could be conveyed through text. Prioritize the first two sections for artwork to get the most value for your budget.
