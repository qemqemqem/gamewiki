Given the limited budget and the need to prioritize, I would suggest focusing on the "Overview" section for its ability to encapsulate the essence of The Shrouded City and provide a strong visual introduction to the setting. The "Architecture" section would be valuable for showcasing the unique design of the city and its iconic structures. The "Culture and Festivals" section could be considered if additional budget allows, as it would add vibrancy and a sense of community to the city's depiction.
