Given the limited budget, the Geography section seems to offer the most value in terms of both artistic and descriptive elements, providing a broad view of the city that can help players visualize the setting they will be exploring. The Culture section could also be valuable, as it adds depth to the players' understanding of the city's inhabitants and their customs. The Economy section, while interesting, might be less critical to invest in from a visual standpoint unless the campaign heavily involves economic elements or trade.
