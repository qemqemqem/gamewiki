Given the limited budget, the value of each piece should be considered in terms of its potential impact on the players' immersion and understanding of the game world. The "Types of Summonings" section is likely to have the highest descriptive and artistic value, as it visually explains the variety of entities that can be summoned. The "Rituals and Components" section could greatly benefit from a visual aid to help players imagine the complexity of summoning rituals. The "Notable Summoners" section may be of lower priority unless these characters play a significant role in the campaign.
