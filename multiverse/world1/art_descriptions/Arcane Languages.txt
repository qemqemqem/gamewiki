Given the limited budget, the "Origins and History" section seems to offer the most value for an illustration, as it sets the foundation for the entire concept of arcane languages and can be rich in detail and narrative. The "Characteristics" section could be valuable as well, especially for educational purposes, but it may not require as much artistic investment. The "Practical Applications" section could be visually striking and help players visualize the use of arcane languages, but it might be less essential if the budget is tight.
