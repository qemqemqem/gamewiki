Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize which images will add the most value to the article. The Echoing Basin and Grimbeorn's Tower are likely to be key visual elements that will enhance the reader's understanding and immersion in the world. The Whispering Woods could also benefit from an image, but if the budget is very tight, it might be the one to skip as it is a more common fantasy trope and may not require as much visual aid for the reader's imagination.
