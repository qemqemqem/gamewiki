Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize the sections that would benefit most from visual representation. The "Origins" and "Role Among the Sun Deities" sections are central to the mythology and would greatly benefit from visual aids, while the "Influence on Arcane Practices" and "Artifacts and Rituals" sections could help players visualize important aspects of the game world. The "Legacy" section, while important, may not require an illustration as it summarizes Pyronus's impact rather than depicting specific events or objects.
