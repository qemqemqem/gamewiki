# Summonings

Summonings, an arcane practice shrouded in mystery and awe, is the art of calling forth entities, creatures, or energies from other planes of existence or distant locations within the same realm. This intricate magical process is a cornerstone of many mystical traditions and is deeply rooted in the history and lore of the world.

## Overview

The act of summoning is not merely a display of magical prowess but a profound ritual that requires a deep understanding of the metaphysical laws that govern the boundaries between worlds. Practitioners of this art, known as [Summoners](Summoner.md), often spend years honing their craft, studying ancient tomes, and learning the secret names of the beings they wish to call forth.

## Types of Summonings

"A summoner channels the arcane to call forth a myriad of beings from different realms.

Summonings can be broadly categorized into several types, each with its own complexities and purposes:

### Elemental Summoning
Elemental summoning involves calling forth beings of pure elemental energy, such as [fire elementals](Fire%20Elementals.md) or [water sprites](Water%20Sprites.md). These entities are often bound to the will of the summoner and employed to perform tasks aligned with their elemental nature.

### Spiritual Summoning
Spiritual summoning is a delicate practice that involves contacting the spirits of the deceased or ethereal entities like the [Whispering Sirens](Whispering%20Sirens.md). Such summonings are fraught with danger, as spirits may harbor their own agendas or become malevolent if coerced.

### Demonic Summoning
The most perilous of all, demonic summoning, is the art of bringing forth entities from the infernal planes. This type of summoning is often outlawed due to the inherent risks and the malevolent nature of the demons themselves.

### Familiar Conjuration
Many [Wizards](Wizards.md) and [Sorcerers](Sorcerers.md) engage in the conjuration of familiars—lesser beings or spirits that serve as companions and helpers. These creatures are usually bound to the summoner through a pact and share a telepathic connection with their master.

## Summoning in Society

Summoning holds a varied place in society, with its perception ranging from revered to reviled. The [Mages of the Crystal Tower](Mages%20of%20the%20Crystal%20Tower.md) are known to practice summonings, utilizing the Echoing Basin's natural amplification properties to enhance their rituals. In contrast, the [Elven](Elven.md) hermits of the [Verdant Woods](Verdant%20Woods.md) may summon creatures as part of their communion with nature.

## Rituals and Components

A summoning ritual typically involves intricate incantations, the use of [arcane foci](Arcane%20Foci.md), and sometimes a physical representation of the entity to be summoned. The complexity of the ritual can vary depending on the power and disposition of the being called upon.

## Notable Summoners

Throughout history, there have been many notable summoners whose deeds have become the stuff of legend. [Seraphine the Seer](Seraphine%20the%20Seer.md), for instance, was said to have summoned the [Moon Deities](Moon%20Deities.md) to gain prophetic insights. Meanwhile, the [occult researchers](Occult%20Researchers.md) of the [Shrouded City](Shrouded%20City.md) delve into forbidden summonings in their quest for knowledge and power.

## Dangers and Precautions

Summonings are not without their risks. The summoned entities may resist control or attempt to harm the summoner and bystanders. Protective circles, binding contracts, and mental fortitude are essential for a summoner to ensure their safety and the safety of others.

## Conclusion

The art of summoning remains a vital aspect of the arcane traditions. Whether it is to seek guidance, gain allies, or harness elemental forces, summoners continue to walk the fine line between control and chaos, shaping the fabric of reality with their will.
