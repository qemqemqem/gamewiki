# Lunar Ancients

The [Lunar Ancients](Lunar%20Ancients.md) are a mysterious and enigmatic group of beings whose existence predates the earliest records of history in the world of Aesheron. These entities are said to have originated from the celestial sphere of the [moon](Moon.md), a place of profound mystique and arcane power. The Lunar Ancients are revered and feared in equal measure, for their knowledge of [sorcery](Sorcery.md) and the arcane arts is unparalleled, and their influence on the world of Aesheron has been both bountiful and catastrophic.

## Origins and Mythology

The true origins of the Lunar Ancients are lost to time, with only fragments of their legacy surviving in the myths and legends passed down through generations. According to the most ancient of these tales, the Lunar Ancients were born from the very essence of the moon itself, crafted by the [moon deities](Moon%20Deities.md) to serve as guardians of its secrets and as a bridge between the celestial and the terrestrial.

During the [Age of Wonders](Age%20of%20Wonders.md), it is said that the moon was not a silent satellite as it is today but a vibrant realm where the Lunar Ancients thrived. Their civilization was one of splendor and wisdom, with magnificent structures like the [Fallen Temple of the Moon](Fallen%20Temple%20of%20the%20Moon.md) that served as bastions of their knowledge and power.

## Influence on Aesheron

The Lunar Ancients' most enduring legacy on Aesheron is the gift of sorcery. In the time of the [Age of Wonders](Age%20of%20Wonders.md), they descended from their lunar domain to share their arcane secrets with the mortal races. This act of generosity gave rise to the first [Wizards](Wizards.md) and shaped the course of magical development for millennia.

The [Keepers of the Eldara Codex](Keepers%20of%20the%20Eldara%20Codex.md) have dedicated themselves to researching the Lunar Ancients, seeking to understand their complex rituals and the true extent of their power. It is believed that the Keepers have uncovered texts that hint at the existence of powerful artifacts and tomes of knowledge created by the Lunar Ancients, which could further expand the understanding of magic.

Among the many wonders attributed to the Lunar Ancients are the [Silvermane Horses](Silvermane%20Horses.md), majestic creatures said to have been created by these celestial beings. These horses possess an otherworldly grace and are rumored to have the ability to traverse the ethereal planes, a gift that reflects the fluid nature of their creators and the influence of the [moon deities](Moon%20Deities.md).

## The Fall of the Lunar Ancients

The decline of the Lunar Ancients is as much a mystery as their rise. Some scholars speculate that their fall was linked to the cataclysmic events of the [Ancient War](Ancient%20War.md), while others believe it was a result of their own hubris and the overreach of their arcane experiments. The [Dark Horde](Dark%20Horde.md), an entity of chaos and destruction, is often mentioned in conjunction with the disappearance of the Lunar Ancients, suggesting a conflict of cosmic proportions.

## Legacy and Remnants

Today, the remnants of the Lunar Ancients' presence on Aesheron are scarce and highly sought after. The [Fallen Temple of the Moon](Fallen%20Temple%20of%20the%20Moon.md) is one of the few known structures that offer a glimpse into their past. Adventurers and scholars alike venture into its depths, hoping to uncover artifacts or knowledge that could unlock further understanding of the Lunar Ancients and their magics.

The influence of the Lunar Ancients is also evident in the various [rituals](Rituals.md) and ceremonies that take place during the lunar cycles, particularly those observed by the [Druids](Druids.md) and the [Mages of the Crystal Tower](Mages%20of%20the%20Crystal%20Tower.md). These practices often involve the invocation of ancient lunar names and the channeling of energies that are believed to be remnants of the Lunar Ancients' power.

## Conclusion

The Lunar Ancients remain a topic of fascination and speculation among the inhabitants of Aesheron. Their legacy continues to shape the world in ways both seen and unseen, as the moon itself continues to inspire awe and wonder in the hearts of those who gaze upon it. The quest for knowledge about the Lunar Ancients is ongoing, and it is certain that their enigmatic history will continue to be a subject of study and exploration for generations to come.
