# Nobility

Nobility in the world of Aesheron is a social class that is often hereditary, conferring upon its members certain privileges, responsibilities, and cultural significance. The nobles of Aesheron are typically associated with the ownership of land, the wielding of power, and the patronage of the arts and sciences. They play a crucial role in the governance and social hierarchy of the realm, often serving as rulers, advisors, or influential figures in various aspects of society.

## Origins and Hierarchy

The origins of nobility in Aesheron can be traced back to the ancient times when the first [Monarchs](Monarchs.md) and chieftains granted lands and titles to their most trusted followers.

The hierarchy within the nobility is complex, with titles such as Duke, Count, Baron, and Knight, each carrying its own rank and prestige.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Nobles are expected to manage their lands and holdings, ensuring the well-being of those who live within their domains. They are responsible for collecting taxes, administering justice, and maintaining a standing force of [Soldiers](Soldiers.md) to defend their territories. In times of war, nobles may be called upon to provide troops and resources to the [kingdom's](Kingdom.md) cause.
