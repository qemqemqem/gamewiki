# Planes of Existence

The [Planes of Existence](Planes%20of%20Existence.md) are the multiple layers of reality that compose the cosmos. Each plane is a unique realm with its own laws, inhabitants, and relationship to the fabric of magic. They range from the material worlds, where mortals dwell, to the ethereal and divine domains that lie beyond the reach of ordinary perception. Understanding the planes is crucial for any [Arcane Practitioner](Arcane%20Practitioner.md), [Cleric](Cleric.md), or scholar of the mystical arts.

## The Material Plane

The Material Plane is the most familiar to the denizens of the world, as it is where the majority of mortal life resides. It is a realm of physical matter, governed by natural laws and the cycles of life and death. This plane is also home to the [Caverns of Echo](Caverns%20of%20Echo.md), the [Isles of Whisper](Isles%20of%20Whisper.md), and the [City of Evernight](City%20of%20Evernight.md), each a testament to the diversity and complexity found within the Material Plane.

## The Ethereal Plane

Bordering the Material Plane is the Ethereal Plane, a misty realm that acts as a buffer between the tangible world and the more esoteric planes. It is a place of ghosts and spirits, where the [Undead](Undead.md) may linger, and where the [Shadow Prowler](Shadow%20Prowler.md) is said to roam. The Ethereal Plane is also the domain through which one must pass to reach other, more distant planes.

## The Elemental Planes

The Elemental Planes are the purest expressions of the natural forces that make up the universe. These include the realms of [Earth Elementals](Earth%20Elementals.md), [Elementals](Elementals.md) of fire, air, and water, and other more esoteric elements like [Aether](Aether.md). Each plane is a vast and often inhospitable environment dominated by its respective element, such as the fiery depths of [Pyronus](Pyronus.md) or the crystalline landscapes of the [Quartz Crystals](Quartz%20Crystals.md) and [Ruby Crystals](Ruby%20Crystals.md) planes.

## The Astral Plane

The Astral Plane is the realm of thought, dreams, and the collective unconscious. It is a silvery sea, connecting the many islands of existence with its starry expanse. [Seers](Seer.md) and [Oracles](Oracle of Morath.md) often explore the Astral Plane in their quest to understand [Fate](Fate.md) and the weave of destiny. The [Keepers of the Eldara Codex](Keepers%20of%20the%20Eldara%20Codex.md) are known to traverse the Astral Plane in search of lost knowledge and ancient truths.

## The Divine Planes

Above all others are the Divine Planes, the realms of gods, demigods, and celestial beings. These planes are often aligned with specific moral or ethical alignments, such as the radiant fields of [Lumina](Lumina.md) or the mournful expanses overseen by the [Lady of Sorrows](Lady%20of%20Sorrows.md). The Divine Planes are sources of immense power and are often the destinations for [Spiritual Summoning](Spiritual%20Summoning.md) and the pursuits of the most devout [Clerics](Clerics.md) and [Paladins](Paladins.md).

## The Shadowfell and the Feywild

The Shadowfell is a dark reflection of the Material Plane, a world of shadows and despair that is intrinsically linked to death and the afterlife. It is here that the [Cult of Sorrow](Cult%20of%20Sorrow.md) contemplates the deeper meanings of existence. In contrast, the Feywild is a vibrant and chaotic echo of the world, teeming with life and magic, where the [Moonflower](Moonflower.md) blooms eternally and the [Moonflower Festival](Moonflower%20Festival.md) is said to have originated.

## The Outer Planes

The Outer Planes are realms of pure philosophy and belief, shaped by the convictions and thoughts of their inhabitants. These planes are often the battlegrounds for the eternal struggles between good and evil, law and chaos. It is rumored that the [Lost Temple of the Moon](Lost%20Temple%20of%20the%20Moon.md) resides in one such plane, guarded by beings whose power is matched only by their inscrutability.

## The Arcane Veins

The [Arcane Veins](Arcane%20Veins.md) are not planes in their own right but are the conduits through which magical energy flows between the planes. They are the pathways that [Evokers](Evoker.md), [Healers](Healers.md), and other practitioners of [Spellcraft](Spellcraft.md) tap into to harness the energies of the cosmos.

## The Sanctum of Visions

Within the [Sanctum of Visions](Sanctum%20of%20Visions.md), the [seers](Seer.md) and mystics study the connections between the planes, seeking to understand the role of [Aether](Aether.md) in the grand tapestry of existence. It is here that the most profound rituals of divination and [Summonings](Summonings.md) are performed, often with the aid of [Tarot Cards](Tarot%20Cards.md) or during the [Storm Festival](Storm%20Festival.md).

The study and exploration of the [Planes of Existence](Planes%20of%20Existence.md) are ongoing, with each discovery leading to more questions than answers. The planes are a testament to the complexity and wonder of the cosmos, offering endless opportunities for adventure, enlightenment, and the pursuit of the arcane.
